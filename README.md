The Clock generator is a complete module based on Si5351 Clock chip, STM32F103 and an interface made of a TFT display a selector and a button to offer a ready to use, but also versatile 3 channels clock solution.

Clocks are everywhere in modern microelectronics, but you might not find anywhere the clock you need when you need it.

With ClockGen you can generate 3 different clocks at frequency from 2.5 KHz to 225 MHz (only Clock 1 above 100 MHz).

You have some control over each clock power (drive). In the MHZ range you can also set a phase shift between two or three clocks. 

There is also a pre-programmed sweep function.
